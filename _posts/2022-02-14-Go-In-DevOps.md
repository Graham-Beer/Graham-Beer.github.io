In this article, I outline why I chose the Go programming language over PowerShell, Python, and JavaScript for my DevOps projects.

In the current world of IT, DevOps engineers are in high demand. A skilled DevOps engineer requires skills in delivering applications and infrastructure rapidly into a production environment. Knowledge of a coding language is a must-have skill if you wish to work in DevOps.
