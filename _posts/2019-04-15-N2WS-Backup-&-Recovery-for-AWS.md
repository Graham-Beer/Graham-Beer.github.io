N2WS Backup & Recovery lets you back up data in Amazon Web Services (AWS) automatically as often as required while also providing quick recovery.

Data backup and data recovery are important parts of running and protecting your business. Data loss can be detrimental, causing application downtime, requiring you to do work twice, forcing you to spend time recovering your environment, and even putting a strain on client relationships. The excellent N2WS product comes into its own here.

A cloud-native backup tool built specifically for AWS, N2WS lets you back up data as often as needed and recover it far more quickly than with traditional on-premises backup solutions, thus simplifying workloads and saving time and resources. N2WS Backup & Recovery, previously known as Cloud Protection Manager (CPM), takes advantage of AWS-native technologies by storing backups as highly-available snapshots in Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3). By moving snapshots from Elastic Block Store (EBS) to S3 storage, you can save costs considerably.
