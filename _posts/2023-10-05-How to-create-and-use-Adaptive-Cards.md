Adaptive Cards are a platform-agnostic specification for defining and rendering rich interactive content within various applications and chat channels, such as Teams or Slack. 
They are primarily used for display purposes in bot messages, notifications, emails, and other platforms where interactivity is desired. The primary idea is to allow 
developers to create a single card definition that can be rendered natively and consistently across multiple platforms. 
In this article, you will learn how to create and use Adaptive Cards with the Adaptive Cards Designer and programmatically with the Adaptive Cards SDK.
