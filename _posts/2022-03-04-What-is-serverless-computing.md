The term serverless computing sounds very cool, but what does it actually mean? In this post, I will introduce AWS Lambda, Amazon's serverless computing service.

The three big cloud providers all have their own serverless infrastructure. Google has Google cloud functions, Azure has Azure functions, and AWS, which we will focus on, has AWS Lambda.

By working with AWS Lambda, we will learn what they are, how they work, and how they differ from using a standard server in the cloud with EC2.

By the end, you should have a strong understanding of serverless. Let's dive in!
