We will be exploring the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to work with temporary security credentials. We will look at how they are set up and used, and then go through an example to put it all together.

In short, STS enables flexibility that provides granular control of more than one AWS service for a certain amount of time. AWS STS supports the following APIs:

- AssumeRole
- AssumeRoleWithSAML
- AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
- DecodeAuthorizationMessage
- GetCallerIdentity
- GetFederationToken
- GetSessionToken
