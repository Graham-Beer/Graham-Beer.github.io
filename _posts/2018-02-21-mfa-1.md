Reading the wonderful series on Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by Sander Berkouwer gave me the idea of sharing a PowerShell 
function that allows you to enable this feature for a single user or multiple users. The ability to automate enabling MFA is very 
powerful for configuring all users the same way. Not having to do this through the GUI also saves valuable time.
