In my last article, titled "What is serverless computing? An introduction to AWS Lambda," we took a detailed look at what 
serverless computing does. Taking the next step, we will create a working example in AWS Lambda using the Go programming 
language (often referred to as Golang).  

For the example, we will create a Lambda function that takes an array of EC2 instance IDs and returns their current status. 
The Lambda function will be written using AWS SDK for Go V2.
