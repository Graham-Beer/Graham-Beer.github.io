Amazon provides three ways you can access and manage Amazon Web Services: AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface 
(AWS CLI), and software development kits (SDKs). Our focus here will be on the software development kit using the Go 
programming language. We will look at what the SDK actually is and how to get up and running with installation and AWS 
account access. As an example, we will use the Go AWS SDK to create an S3 bucket.
